### This test automation framework was created using Cypress with javascript, and also in order to complete the Turn QA Home Task.
### You only need to clone the project preferably using Visual Studio Code and follow the next steps:

### Install dependencies
> npm init
> npm yarn

### Installation of Cypress
> npm install cypress --save-dev

### Runing the application: 
everything is configured, you only need to execute the following command.
> npm test

### Allure Reports
After to finilize the test execution, the application is gonna open the allure report page on the browser, you don´t need to do some else. ¡Yes, that´s amazing!
